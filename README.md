# Smart Queue Management System 🚦

A simple Java-based console project to manage queues in banks, hospitals, and offices. It helps reduce waiting time by efficiently organizing and prioritizing customers based on their urgency.

## 💡 Features

- Add customers to the queue
- Assign priority levels (Emergency, Senior Citizen, Regular)
-  ## 🎯 Priority Logic

The system uses a Priority Queue where:

> 🔢 Lower numbers = Higher priority

| Customer Type      | Priority Value | Description                |
|--------------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| Emergency          | 1              | Highest priority – served first  
| Senior Citizen     | 2              | Medium priority  
| Regular Customer   | 3              | Lowest priority – served after others

- Serve customers based on priority and arrival time (using DSA concepts like PriorityQueue)
- Display current queue status
- Remove served customers
- Real-time simulation using console
